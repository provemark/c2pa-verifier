# Changelog

This project follows the milestones in `docs/milestones.md`; each entry
below names the milestone, the specs that closed it and the day it was
measured against `c2patool` 0.27.22. There is no tagged release yet and
nothing on Packagist; the first tag comes when the maintainer decides the
public API is stable. Dates are the day the work was committed.

## Unreleased

### The command line (2026-09-22)
- SPEC-019: `bin/c2pa-verify <file> [--settings <path>]` — the report as
  `toJson()` on standard output, `Error: …` on standard error, exit status
  0 (`Trusted`/`Valid`), 1 (`Invalid`, report printed), 2 (no report).
  Registered as a Composer `bin`. `c2patool`'s exit status was measured
  first and departed from where it is fail-open (exit 0 on `Invalid`; a
  missing settings file ignored).
- Fixed: `toJson()` threw `JsonException` on a manifest whose
  `claim_generator_info` carries a byte string (OpenAI's generator icon);
  bytes now render as base64 like every other value (SPEC-007
  amendment 5, found by SPEC-019's corpus criterion).

### M6 — RFC 3161 timestamps (2026-09-22)
- SPEC-016: an own DER reader (`src/Asn1/`) and the timestamp token as data
  (`src/Timestamp/`) — `TimeStampResp`/`TimeStampToken`, `SignedData`,
  `SignerInfo`, `TSTInfo`, bounded, every fault with its offset.
- SPEC-017: the timestamp check — the CMS signature (RSA PKCS#1, ECDSA,
  RSASSA-PSS; DER and raw R‖S; the DER-sorted `SET` of signed attributes),
  the imprint over the `CounterSignature` bytes, the TSA's profile and
  chain through the trust settings, the six `timeStamp.*` codes (all
  informational), `signature_info.time`, and the time the signer's
  validity is judged at — only a validated *and* trusted timestamp
  supplies it. ADR-0004.
- SPEC-018: the actions assertion — a 2.x manifest opens with
  `c2pa.created` or `c2pa.opened`, or it is `assertion.action.malformed`.
- SPEC-013 amendment 9: a remote manifest declared by URL is reported
  (`remote_manifest`), never fetched.
- Fixed: a correctly signed manifest with no hard binding was `Valid`
  (SPEC-013 amendment 10, `claim.hardBindings.missing`); a 2.x manifest
  without an actions assertion was `Valid` (SPEC-018). See `SECURITY.md`.
- Fixed: negative RFC 3161 nonces refused as malformed; fractional `genTime`
  dropped from `signature_info.time`; the CMS signature verified over the
  attributes as written rather than the DER-sorted `SET` (SPEC-016
  amendment 3, SPEC-017 amendments 2–3 — found through the writers corpus).
- Fixtures: `tests/Fixtures/writers/` (OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, `c2pa-ts`,
  Adobe Photoshop, a CAWG file, a Pixel 10 photo, a Lightroom Classic
  export) as a fourth drift alarm; TSA anchors cut from the tokens;
  `tests/Fixtures/absence/` (signed manifests with one thing absent);
  `bin/fuzz.php` (70 870 mutated files, no exception escaped).

### M5 — certificate chain and trust (2026-09-21)
- SPEC-014: trust settings in `c2patool`'s JSON shape, the allowed list,
  the chain walk to an anchor on `openssl_x509_verify`; `Trusted`.
- SPEC-015: the C2PA 2.4 §14.5 certificate profile; `signature_info`.
  ADR-0003.
- Fixtures: `c2pa-org/public-testfiles` (24 JPEGs) and `c2pa-rs`'s own (17
  files) as drift alarms; CBOR floats and indefinite lengths accepted and
  bounded (SPEC-006 amendments 2–3); a data-hash exclusion must *cover*
  the store (SPEC-012 amendment 5); multi-manifest stores and CAWG
  assertions refused until validated (SPEC-013 amendments 5, 7).

### M4 — hash binding (2026-09-21)
- SPEC-011: the hashed URI of every assertion the claim names;
  undeclared assertions refused.
- SPEC-012: `c2pa.hash.data` over the asset, streamed in 64 KiB chunks,
  exclusions sorted and checked, one hard binding per manifest.

### M3 — COSE_Sign1 (2026-09-21)
- SPEC-008: the COSE_Sign1 structure, protected `x5chain`, Sig_structure.
- SPEC-009: ES256/384/512, PS256/384/512 (an own EMSA-PSS verifier for
  ordinary RSA keys), Ed25519 (opt-in `sodium`), R‖S → DER.
- SPEC-010: the report — `validation_state`, the §15 status codes
  verbatim, `validation_results` and `validation_status` as `c2patool`
  prints them.

### M2 — JUMBF and CBOR (2026-09-21)
- SPEC-005: the JUMBF box tree with bounds. SPEC-006: a CBOR decoder for
  the subset C2PA uses. SPEC-007: claim v1 and v2, assertions,
  `claim_generator_info`; equal to `c2patool`'s JSON through the sister
  library's parser.

### M1 — containers (2026-09-20)
- SPEC-001: JPEG APP11 (multi-segment). SPEC-002: PNG `caBX`. SPEC-003:
  WebP RIFF `C2PA`. SPEC-004: a bounded stream reader. Byte-exact
  extraction, measured by hash against `c2patool`.

### M0 — skeleton (2026-09-19)
- SPEC-000: the spec template and `bin/spec-check.php`; CI on PHP
  8.3/8.4/8.5; Pint, PHPStan level max, Deptrac, Pest; ADR-0001
  (dependencies: none), ADR-0002 (name, namespace, MIT).
